# install TeamViewer on a headless Linux system via a link, follow these steps:

# Call up the path of an internally accessible installation file (.rpm/.deb) or an installation file on our website (https://www.teamviewer.com/download/linux/) in the Terminal with the wget command. Make sure that you use the installation file of the full version.
# Start the installation.
# Run the command “teamviewer setup” after the installation is completed.
# Accept the end-user license agreement.
# Enter the login credentials for your TeamViewer account. This will assign the Linux device to your account and set up unattended access.

# Confirm the assignment.
# The device appears in your Computers & Contacts list. Connect with a double-click. During a session, a TeamViewer icon appears in the top right corner on the remote device.
